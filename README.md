# Data-Pack / Game-Rule Menus

Makes the eponymous menus accessible from already from singleplayer worlds.

## Word of caution: Datapacks

Some built-in datapacks are not "just" datapacks, and require special handling. A warning screen will be shown whenever you attempt to enable or disable any of these, and give you the option to back out. 

### Feature Packs

When packs that include experimental features (such as bundles) are toggled, and the approriate feature flag will be toggled on the world.

However, **unlike regular datapacks those will not take effect until you restart the world.** If you had to go through a warning screen in order to toggle something, you'll probably want to restart the world immediately.

### Vanilla Datapack

The vanilla datapack can technically be disabled, but doing so will break worlds most of the times. The uses cases for this are very marginal, so you probably don't want to do it.

An additional warning screen will appear when trying to disable this pack.

If you can't load a world after having disabled the Vanilla datapack, loading it in Safe Mode should be able to restore it.
